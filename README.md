# Dothraki Language App

This application utilizes a spaced repetition algorithm with the intention of enabling a user to study the Dothraki language from the show Game Of Thrones. After registration and login, the user is then prompted with different Dothraki words and required to answer the english equivalent of that word. The questions from the Dothraki Language App were implemented using a queue data structure that stores and rotates the questions in each individual user's saved database.
